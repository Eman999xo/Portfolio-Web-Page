			<h2>About Eman</h2>

			<section>
				<h3>Why Thinkful?</h3>
				<p>After graduating High School, I enrolled in the University of Maryland and took the major of Buisness Administration. Although I love buisness, I decided to put a hold on to my college education to focus on coding. I Always had a knack for coding ever since High School. I took AP Comp Science as well as toyed around with the programming language Swift for a bit. Although back then, I wasnt as serious as I am today. So here I am :D
